# picocalc-frotz

This is an unofficial port of Frotz to the PicoCalc. Frotz has been actively developed since 1995 and is a popular interpreter for Z-Machine games, including those from Infocom.

This project adds a small amount of code to integrate the included modules. Each module (picocalc-text-starter and frotz), which are unmodified, work together to provide a complete experience for playing Z-Machine games on the PicoCalc.

# Getting Started

Flash the PicoCalc with the latest release and reboot your PicoCalc.

A simple story selector is presented when you turn on the PicoCalc. This lists the stories stored in the `/stories` directory on the SD card. You select a story to play, and press enter to begin.

> [!TIP]
>A Pico 2 (W) or other RP2350-based device is highly recommended. The stories are loaded from the SD card into RAM. The RP2350-based boards have 520 KiB of RAM over the RP2040's 264 KiB, which allows for larger stories to be loaded.

# Modules

- [PicoCalc Text Starter](https://github.com/BlairLeduc/picocalc-text-starter) - This module provides the drivers for the LCD display, keyboard, audio and file system support for the SD card.

- [Frotz](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/frotz) â€“ An interpreter for all Infocom and other Z-machine games. Complies with the Z-Machine Standard version 1.1.

_Note: the settings.ini file is not used by this project right now. The settings are hardcoded in the `picocalc/init.c` file._
